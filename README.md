Image Captioning

Aim: This project is used to give description of an image using Artificial intelligence.
Example: If we give below image as input.

Our model will generate description of this image as below:
“two men are playing soccer”

Training Data: Flickr-8K

Concepts used: 
1.	Image processing
2.	Convolutional neural networks
3.	ResNet50
4.	Word Embedding
5.	Natural language processing
6.	Recurrent neural networks
7.	LSTM
8.	Deep learning
9.	Multi layer perceptron

How to use: Put images for which we want to generate captions in Images folder. Then Run Caption_it file in jupyter-notebook. At end, all images will be printed with their descriptions.
